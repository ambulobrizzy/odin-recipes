        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Haneeth is a very popular Yemeni dish of slow roasted lamb that’s marinated in a mixture of spices and slow roasted until the meat is so tender it nearly falls off the bone. It’s usually served with basmati rice (which is usually also spiced but can be plain). It’s a very typical celebratory dish served at festivals and weddings, and very common in Yemeni restaurants around the worl</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>What do You need to make this dish?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lamb:</strong> I used about 1.5 lbs of lamb meat with bone, and I chose to use lamb shanks which I recommend for how tender and delicious they turn out. </li>
            <li> <strong>Green onions, chives, and garlic cloves:</strong> These are blended with the other marinade ingredients. Interesting preparation but it works to tenderize the meat and add a lot of flavor!</li>
            <li> <strong>Spices:</strong> Cumin powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, cinnamon powder, whole cloves and cardamom pods, bay leaves</li>
            <li> <strong>Dried or preserved lemon (lumee):</strong> This is totally optional, so don’t worry if you can’t find them. They are a very pungent, dry, black dried lemon (or lime) that are often used in Khaleeji cooking. I like adding a couple to the roasting pan while the lamb cooks.</li>
            <li> <strong>Olive oil and Butter:</strong> These are blended with the marinade ingredients and are used to coat the lamb. This will give a great moistness to the inside of the lamb and slightly crispy roasted exterior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <h4>It’s so easy! </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>You need to puree all the ingredients <strong>(except for the dried lemons and obviously the lamb), in a blender or food processor.</strong></p>

                <p>This means everything from the green onions and chives, spices (including the whole spices like the cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaves), and the olive oil and butter all get blended up. You’ll get a thick green paste. If it’s too thick that it isn’t blending properly, add a splash of water just to get the mixer going.</p>  </li>
            <li>Pour the paste over the lamb in a roasting dish. Using your hands, coat the lamb thoroughly with the marinade. Cover tightly with a sheet of parchment paper, then aluminum foil. Marinate for as long as you have, anywhere from 4 hour to overnight, the longer the better! I managed about 6 hours.  </li>
            
            <h4>How to slow roast Yemeni lamb:</h4>
            <li>I  found this roasting method the easiest. The concept is to cook at a high temperature (465 F or 240C) for the first hour. This will help to brown the outside of the lamb and seal in the moisture and juices.  </li>
            <li>After the first hour of cooking, reduce the temperature to 350 F (180C) and cook for another hour.  </li>
            <li>Once another hour passes, toss the lamb pieces around, and cover again and resume cooking. After another 30 minutes, uncover the dish, and cook for the last 30 minutes uncovered so that the lamb further crisps on the surface, and it’ll be tender and cooked through if you pull some off the bone with a fork.  </li>
        </ol>
